""" Emily is a data analyst working for a company that collects feedback from customers in the form of text messages. As part of her data validation tasks, Emily needs to perform two operations on each message:



Calculate the sum of all the digits mentioned in the message.
If the sum of the digits is greater than 9, check whether the sum forms a palindrome number.


Your task is to help Emily automate this process by writing a program that extracts all digits from a given message, calculates their sum, and checks if the sum is a palindrome if it is greater than 9.

Input format :
The input consists of a string s, representing the customer message, which may contain letters, digits, spaces, and other characters.

Output format :
The output prints an integer representing the sum of all digits in the string, followed by a space.



If the sum is greater than 9, print "Palindrome" if the sum is a palindrome, otherwise print "Not palindrome".

If the sum is less than or equal to 9, no palindrome check is required."""

s=input()
sum1=0

for ch in s:
    if ch.isdigit():
        sum1=sum1+int(ch)
print(sum1, end=' ')
    
if sum1>9:
    s=str(sum1)
    if s==s[::-1]:
        print("Palindrome")
    else:
        print("Not palindrome")
